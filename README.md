-Content: Contain almost all aspects (theoretical+technical aspects) about classical statistics and computational statistics. (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Model Selection, EM, Bootstrap, ANN, SVM...). To be fair, this subject was the hardest subject I've ever had in my life...

-Lecturer: Well, if we simply talk about Karim himself, he is definitely a very good professor, he answered all of my questions in detail and waited for my response when I talked to him in offline consultation sessions. However, his teaching style is the most wired one I've ever seen in my life... His note is very messy and it's seems that he was teaching himself during lecture... I cannot understand what he was talking even through watching recordings repeatedly. (Slides are totally usefuless..)

-Exam: Again, to be fair, this subject was the hardest subject I've ever had in my life... (All of content are examinable, that's true.. even including his messy and unrecognizable notes.)
